This project explores factors influencing stroke risk using real-world health data. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, which underscores the importance of identifying key risk factors.

The analysis was conducted in R, focusing on data mining and visualization to uncover meaningful insights. Using Plotly, we created interactive visualizations to better understand how factors such as age, lifestyle, and health conditions contribute to stroke risk.

The projectâ€™s results were summarized in a research poster, highlighting data-driven insights that can inform prevention strategies and raise awareness of stroke risks.
